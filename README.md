# Bestway Spa Integration (Rough Implementation)

⚠️ **This is NOT a production-ready integration** ⚠️

This repository contains a very rough implementation of the latest Bestway Spa connection to Home Assistant. It is **not intended to be used as a proper library** and I don't have time to maintain it as a freely usable integration.

## Purpose

This integration exists solely as **inspiration** for developers who want to help update the original, well-maintained integration:

**[ha-bestway](https://github.com/cdpuk/ha-bestway)** - The proper, maintained Bestway Spa integration for Home Assistant

## What This Provides

- A working implementation that can communicate with the latest Bestway app version
- Code examples showing how to handle the updated API/protocol
- Reference implementation for the communication layer

## For Developers

You are **free to chop and choose** what you use from this integration. The goal is to help the original `ha-bestway` library get updated more quickly by providing working examples of the latest communication methods.

## Recommendation

**Please use the original [ha-bestway](https://github.com/cdpuk/ha-bestway) integration** and contribute any improvements there. This repository is just a reference implementation to help speed up that process.
